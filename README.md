## Hi there 👋

I’m Bea, a 3rd year BS Computer Science student at UP Baguio.
I’m passionate about turning design ideas into pretty and functional interfaces. I’m currently diving into React and Figma to grow as a Front-end Web Developer and UI/UX Designer.

Outside of code and design, you’ll find me watching anime, exploring photography, or traveling to new places. I’m always eager to learn more and collaborate on creative, user-centered projects.
