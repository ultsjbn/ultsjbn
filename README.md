## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Bea, a 2nd year BS Computer Science student at UP Baguio.
Iâ€™m passionate about turning design ideas into pretty and functional interfaces. Iâ€™m currently diving into React and Figma to grow as a front-end developer and UI/UX designer.

Outside of code and design, youâ€™ll find me watching anime, exploring photography, or traveling to new places. Iâ€™m always eager to learn more and collaborate on creative, user-centered projects.
